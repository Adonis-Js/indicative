In this guide, we will learn about how to add new validation and sanitization rules to indicative.

toc::[]

== Adding validation rules
Validation rules are added by defining a new `key/value` pair on the validations object.

Let's start by creating a function to validate the time format.

[source, js]
----
const timeRegex = /([01]?[0-9]|2[0-3]):[0-5][0-9](:[0-5][0-9])?/

const timeFn = function (data, field, message, args, get) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const fieldValue = get(data, field)

    if (fieldValue && !timeRegex.test(fieldValue)) {
      return reject(message)
    }

    resolve('validation passed')
  })
}
----

Next, attach it to the existing validations object.

[source, js]
----
const { validations } = require('indicative')
validations.time = timeFn
----

With *custom build* it is as simple as passing a new key/value pair.

[source, js]
----
import Validator from 'indicative/builds/validator'
import { email, required } from 'indicative/builds/validations'

const validatorInstance = Validator({ email, required, time: timeFn })
----

Now you can make use of the `time` rule as any other rule.

== Adding sanitization rules
The sanitization rules are attached to the `sanitizor` object when using the full build.

[source, js]
----
const { sanitizor } = require('indicative')
sanitizor.camelCase = function (value) {
  return _.camelCase(value)
}
----

For customized build, you can pass key/value pair when instantiating the *Sanitizor* instance.

[source, js]
----
import Sanitizor from 'indicative/builds/sanitizor'
import { normalizeEmail } from 'indicative/builds/sanitizations'

const camelCase = function (value) {
  return _.camelCase(value)
}

const sanitizorInstance = Sanitizor({ normalizeEmail, camelCase })
----
