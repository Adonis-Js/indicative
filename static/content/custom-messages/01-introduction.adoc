The validation messages returned by the validator are not something you should be showing to your end-users and instead define a set of custom messages, which are more thoughtful and easy to act upon.

[source, text]
----
✔ Please choose a unique username for your account
----

.is better than
[source, text]
----
✖ required validation failed on username

== Defining messages
Messages are defined as an object of key/value pairs and passed to the `validate` method as 3rd argument.

[source, js]
----
const messages = {
  required: 'The field is required'
}

validate(data, rules, messages)
----

Also you can define a different message for each field.

[source, js]
----
const messages = {
  'username.required': 'Please choose a unique username for your account',
  'email.required': 'Enter a valid email address.'
}
----

And same is true for nested arrays.

[source, js]
----
const messages = {
  'users.*.username.required': 'Please choose a unique username for your account'
}
