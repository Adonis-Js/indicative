Converts empty strings and `undefined` to `null`. It is
handy to keep data normalized at database level.

----
const sanitizationRules = {
  bio: 'to_null'
}

// or
const sanitizationRules = {
  bio: [
    rule('to_null')
  ]
}
----
For customized build, you can import this rule as follows.
[source, js]
----
import { toNull } from 'indicative/builds/sanitizations'
